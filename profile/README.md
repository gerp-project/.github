# GERP Project :octopus:

## Goal :revolving_hearts:

We are on a mission to reduce tedious, manual maintenance Pull Requests for GitHub repositories.

In maintaining the Azure Kubernetes Service Github Actions, we found ourselves making edits across over a dozen repos that each held an action.

While hacky local scripting could work around this, we wanted a clean way to keep the templates for things like bug reports and issues synchronized across our repos.

For the Microsoft 2022 Hackathon we decided to create GERP to solve this problem.

gerp uses a single template repo to synchronize repository templates via batch Pull Requests.

## Getting started :rocket:

You can get started over at the [GERP repo](https://github.com/gerp-project/gerp).
